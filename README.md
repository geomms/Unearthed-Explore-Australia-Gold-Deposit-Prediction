# Unearthed Explore Australia: Gold Deposit Prediction

## Flatiron School Capstone Project

### Author: Mark Subra
This project is the capstone project for the Data Science Immersive Bootcamp at Flatiron School. The project is based on the [Unearthed: Explorer Challenge](https://unearthed.solutions/u/challenge/1million-prize-pool-find-australias-next-big-mineral-deposit). The scale of the challenge was too large to be able to complete in the timeframe given, so a binary classification of gold mines was eventually decided to be the goal.

### Business Understanding and Background
Every year, each person in the United states uses [40,633 pounds of new minerals](https://mineralseducationcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019-Mining-Cart-Per-Capita-color.pdf). Mining involves many challenges from exploration to environmental remediation. Ore-bearing, large-scale deposits are rare due to various geological processes taking place in combination over time. Predicting mineral deposits will lower exploration costs and unnecessary drilling and/or excavation which will also cause less harm to the environment.
